#The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog, but jumped so high he reached the heavens. There, there was a chariot being driven around and around by three golden deer. As the deer approached the fox, they asked him questions. "Why are you here, is this not a miserable place?". "Why come to a place such as this, where your shoulders ache and your legs quake". The fox looked puzzled, as his shoulders and legs were as they were when he was on the floor.
#So he said as such. "I quite don't know what aches and quakes you speak of, quick deer. My body is as firm and fit as it was when I was below the clouds". But the deer, still going round and round, sneered at this assertion. "But it has always been this way, fox. Here, shoulders ache and legs ache, and such is the way of life. So either you are above everyone else, or you aren't alive" Fox pondered this for a moment.
#He looked at his paws, and saw his fur not rotten. He scratched his ears, and saw they still heard. He sat down, and saw his legs still sat. "I am rather certain I am not dead, deer. So, therefore, I must be above you all". and so he was'.
